**Introduction**

The purpose of this document is to present the data flow between the payment terminal and the mobile application gateway.
Demos applications are also provided below to allow development team to test prototypes they are working on.

**Terminology**

Some terms are used in our documentation, so it's good to define them below
Payment Terminal : NFC device powered with NXP (PN7642 chip) to be used to acquire payment requests from MIFARE® _DESFire_® _EV3_ card
Payment Gateway : Mobile app deployed on android device to serve as gateway to backend payment system. Connection between Payment Terminal and Payment Gateway is done via Bluetooth (BLE)

## Data Flow

There are 2 data flow between the Payment Terminal and the Payment Gateway, one data flow for card payment and a second data flow for Payment Terminal synchronisation with backend payment system.

**DESFire EV3 Card initiated Data Flow**

As the title stated, this data flow is triggered by DESFire EV3 card presented to the PN7642 chip NFC reader/writer on the Payment Terminal.
